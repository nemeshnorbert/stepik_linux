Access control lists
    Access control list (ACL) provides an additional, more flexible permission mechanism for file systems.
    getfacl - get file access control lists
        Example
            getfacl <FILE_NAME>

    setfacl - set file access control lists
        Example
            setfacl -m u:<USER_NAME>:<ONE_DIGIT_ACCESS_RIGHTS> <FILE_NAME>  # set access rights as <ONE_DIGIT_ACCESS_RIGHTS> for the user <USER_NAME> for the file <FILE_NAME>
        Example
            setfacl -m g:<GROUP_NAME>:<ONE_DIGIT_ACCESS_RIGHTS> <FILE_NAME>  # set access rights as <ONE_DIGIT_ACCESS_RIGHTS> for the group <GROUP_NAME> for the file <FILE_NAME>
        Example
            setfacl -x <USER_NAME> <FILE_NAME>  # delete user <USER_NAME> from access control list for the file <FILE_NAME>
        Example
            setfacl -b <FILE_NAME>  # delete all access control lists for the file <FILE_NAME>

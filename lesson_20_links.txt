Links
    Any linux filesystem stores files and their metainformation.
    File metainformation is stored in special data structures called inodes.
    Inodes contain file access rights, size, creation date (but not file name!)
    Any linux directory is a special file (like a table) that stores mapping from its file names to inodes
    Any inodes can have multiple names.
    Entries in directories that are just another name for some inode are called hard links.
    Everytime one performs an action on hard link one effectively works with the file the hard link points to
    Inode is deleted if there is no names assigned to. Therefore inode is not deleted if there is a hard link pointing to it
    On linux systems we also have symbolic links.
    Symbolic link is a special file that stores name of another file.
    Every time one performs an action on a symbolic link one effectively works with the file the soft link points to

    Example
        ln <FILE_NAME> <HARD_LINK_NAME>  # create a hard link <HARD_LINK_NAME> that points to a file <FILE_NAME>
    Example
        ln -s <FILE_NAME> <SYMBOLIC_LINK_NAME>  # create a symbolic link <SYMBOLIC_LINK_NAME> that points to a <FILE_NAME>
